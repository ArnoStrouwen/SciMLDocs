# [Getting Started with Julia's SciML](@id getting_started)

## Quickly: What is Julia's SciML Ecosystem?

Julia's SciML is:

* SciPy or MATLAB's standard library but in Julia, but
* Runs orders of magnitude faster, even outperforms C and Fortran libraries, and
* Is fully compatible with machine learning and automatic differentiation,
* All while having an easy-to-use high level interactive development environment.

* [How do I install SciML software?](@ref installation)
* [Build and run your first simulation](@ref first_sim)
* [Solve your first optimization problem](@ref first_opt)
* [Fit a simulation to a dataset](@ref fit_simulation)
* [Find the root of an equation (i.e. solve f(x)=0)](@ref find_root)

!!! note
    Each of the SciML packages starts with its own introductory tutorial as well! Once you
    have started to get the hang of a few things, start checking out the introductory
    tutorials of the different packages. For example, 
    [the DifferentialEquations.jl getting started tutorial is a fun one!](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/getting_started/)
